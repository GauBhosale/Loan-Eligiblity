Steps to Build Rule Based Model Using Streamlit and Google Colab

1. Building the Frontend of the Application
😎 Install Required Libraries: streamlit, pyngrok
🖥️ Create the Frontend of the App Using Streamlit in an app.py File
2. Deploying the Application Using Streamlit

Simple Rule Based Model
Columns: Gender, Marital Status, Monthly Income, Loan Amount

If monthly income > 50000, loan will be approved
Else, loan will be rejected
If monthly income > 50000, loan will be approved. Else, if loan amount < 500000, loan will be approved. Else, loan will be rejected



Steps to Build the Loan Eligibility Model Using Machine Learning Model Using Streamlit

1. Building the Frontend of the Application
😎 Install Required Libraries: streamlit, pyngrok
🖥️ Create the Frontend of the App Using Streamlit in an app.py File
2. Loading the Dataset Using Pandas
3. Pre-processing the Dataset
   Convert categories into numbers using map function
   Separate dependent (X) and independent variables (Y)
4. Building the Loan Prediction Model
   Import machine learning model logistics regression (Since binary)
   Save the model into a pickle file to avoid training the model repeatedly
5. Deploying the Application Using Streamlit
